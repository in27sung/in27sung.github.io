## Chapter 1. The Machine Learning Landscape

In this chapter I will start by clarifying what machine learning is and why you may want to use it.
Then, befroe we set out to explore the machine learning continent, we will take a look at the map and elarn about the main regions and the most notable landmarks: supervised versus unsupervised learning and thier varinats, online versus batch learning, instance-based versus model-based learning. Then we will look at the workflow of a typical ML project, dicuss the main challenges you may face, and cover how to evaluate and fine-tune a machine learning system.

### What Is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data.

Here is a slightly more general definition:

> "Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." â€“ Arther Samuel, 1959

And a more engineering-oriented one:

> "A computer program is said to learn from expereince E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by Pm improves with expereience E. - Tom Mitchell, 1997

Your spam filter is a machine learning program that, given examples of spam emails (flagged by users) and examples of regular emails (nonspam, also called "ham"), can learn to flag spam. The examples that the system uses to learn are called the **training set**. Each training example is called a **training instance** (or sample). The part of a machine learning system that learns and makes predictions is called a **model**. Neural networks and random forests are examples of modles. the task T is to flag spam for new emails, the expereience E is thr training data, and the performance measure P needs to be defined; for example, you can use the ratio of correctly classified emails. This particular performance measure is called **accuracy**, and it is often used in classification tasks.

### Why Use Machine Learning?

Consider how you would write a spam filter using traditional programming techniques (Figure 1-1):

1. First you would examine what spam typically looks like. You might notice that some words or phrases (such as "4U", "credit card", "free", and "amazing") tend to come up a lot in the subject line. Perhaps you would also notice a few other patterns in the sender's name, the email's body, and other parts of the eamil.

2. You would write a detection algorithm for each of the patterns that you noticed, and your program would flag emails as spam if a number of these patterns were detected.

3. You would test your program and repeat steps 1 and 2 until it was good enough to launch.
