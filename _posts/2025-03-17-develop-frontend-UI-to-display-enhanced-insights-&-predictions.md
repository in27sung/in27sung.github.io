## üìå Phase 1.4 - Develop Frontend UI to Display Enhanced Insights & Predictions

---

## 1. Objectives

### ‚úÖ Goal
Build an intuitive, responsive React-based UI to visualise enhanced API insights and predictions for informed user decision-making.

### üéØ Key Tasks
1. **Design Insight Visualisation Components:** Create interactive charts and summary cards.
2. **Display Performance Metrics & Analytics:** Clearly present API response metrics and statistical insights.
3. **Enhance User Experience (UX):** Ensure seamless interaction with data filters, real-time updates, and responsive layouts.
4. **Integrate Prediction Results:** Visually highlight AI-generated forecasts and anomaly alerts.

## 2. Task Breakdown

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ UI Component Development
- **Task:** Build reusable React components for data visualisation and summary display.
- **Subtasks:**
  - [ ] Implement performance metrics cards (elapsed time, cache status).
  - [ ] Develop stock summary cards (high, low, volatility, trend).
  - [ ] Design anomaly & prediction notification banners.
  - [ ] Include data download/export options (CSV, JSON).
- **Expected Output:** Modular, maintainable React components ready for integration.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualisation Integration
- **Task:** Integrate visualisation libraries for enhanced charts and graphs.
- **Subtasks:**
  - [ ] Use **Recharts** for line charts, bar charts, and trend visualisation.
  - [ ] Implement real-time data updates (WebSockets/long polling if applicable).
  - [ ] Apply responsive chart layouts for multi-device compatibility.
- **Expected Output:** Clear, interactive data visualisation supporting decision-making.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ User Interaction & Filters
- **Task:** Enhance interactivity with filters and customisation options.
- **Subtasks:**
  - [ ] Implement date range selectors and stock filter dropdowns.
  - [ ] Add toggle switches for viewing raw data vs. summarised insights.
  - [ ] Provide customisable chart display settings (time intervals, indicators).
- **Expected Output:** Flexible, user-driven control over displayed data.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Insight & Prediction Presentation
- **Task:** Display AI-generated insights prominently.
- **Subtasks:**
  - [ ] Highlight trend predictions with contextual labels.
  - [ ] Show detected anomalies with visual markers (e.g., icons, colour shifts).
  - [ ] Include interpretative text summaries generated by the backend AI analysis.
- **Expected Output:** Clearly presented insights facilitating immediate user comprehension.
