As you start to think about your own future role in data science, it can help yo investigate how data is being used within different industries. In this reading, you'll consider some examples of industries and how data science helps guide them. You'll also consider the future of data science and how the field is still evolving!

There are so many different industries taking advantage of data science in so many different ways. Here is just a sample of some of these industries and how they use data:

| Industry | Overview | How data is used |
|---------|---------|----------------|

### Data trends for the future
As you can already tell, data analytics is an emerging field with a wide reange of exciting opportunities. And, even more exciting is the fact that big data is getting bigger. The need for people to undertsnad, prioritise, manage, and analyse that information is not slwoing down in any industry. Businesses will continue to rely on data-driven decision-making, fueled by both dimple trend analyses and more complex techniques like predictive modeling and forecasting.

Additionally, more complaines are storing all of their raw data within large repositories accessible across the organisation. As companies become more reliant on insights generated by this dat, there will be many opportunities for data analytics professionals to sue their skills and knowledge to organise that information and make it useful.
