As you’ve been learning, there are many steps that go into preparing for your job search in the data career space. Before you even start applying for jobs, it’s important that you take two key steps. You need to build a professional online presence and develop your portfolio to showcase your skills to potential employers. This is also a great time to connect with mentors, who can provide professional insight and help you prepare for the application process. The interview will often be the final step in this process; in addition to all of the other job prep you’ll do, preparing for the interview will help you approach this last step confidently. To help get you ready for the job market, this reading will explore four different interview types and offer interview questions that this certificate program will help you answer. 

### Establishing your professional narrative

Establishing a professional narrative, or brand, can help you build connections between your daily work and the positive influence it has on something bigger. This something bigger could be an exciting project that you helped finish or a positive change in your organization or community! This applies to the work you have done previously and the work you hope to do in the roles you apply for. Framing your experience and goals around your professional narrative allows you to develop a stronger sense of the value you bring to an organization and your own career goals. Keeping your professional narrative top of mind is important as you prepare to enter or navigate the data professional career space. Your personal brand is the value you offer potential employers. It can often provide answers to questions posed during the interview process. 

### Interview question types 
There are many different types of interview questions and each organization has its own priorities for what they want to know about each applicant for each role. Interview questions typically belong to one of four categories:  

- **Behavioral questions:** These questions ask you to describe how you have handled specific situations in the past, and your personal characteristics. They are designed to assess your skills, experience, and problem-solving abilities, as well as your fit for the company culture.

- **Technical questions:** These questions ask you to demonstrate the knowledge and skills presented in your resume or portfolio. In job interviews for technical positions, an employer may ask for a demonstration of specific tasks, prior projects, or even a take-home assessment. Often these technical demonstrations are presented as a separate assignment that you will complete outside of the interview itself. These questions are designed to assess your technical skills and expertise.

- **Situational questions:** These questions ask you how you would handle hypothetical situations. Similar to behavioral questions, employers typically use situational questions to develop a preliminary understanding of how your skills fit the role. Situational questions are designed to assess your judgment, critical thinking skills, and ability to apply knowledge to new situations.

- **Subject questions:** These questions ask you about your knowledge of a specific subject or area, usually pertaining to the field or industry that you’re applying for. These questions are designed to determine how well you understand the relationship between the role you’re applying for and the broader context of the company. Employers may also use these questions to assess your understanding of how the company works in contrast to direct competitors in the marketplace. 

These are just a few examples of the types of questions you might be asked in interviews. These categories aren’t universal, and different organizations have different interview styles– they may even ask questions that combine categories. For example, an interviewer might give you a hypothetical situation and ask you for an example of a previous situation you’ve encountered that relates. This is a combination of a behavioral and situational question. Generally, the goal of interview questions is to assess your skills, experience, and general fit for the role; so keep that in mind as you prepare.
