## Project Report: Predicting Country-Level Happiness Scores

### Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between countries' happiness scores and key economic and social indicators. It aims to build a robust predictive model while addressing data quality challenges such as missing values and inconsistent formatting. The output includes complete data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, evaluation, and interpretation.

---

### Dataset Description
The dataset combines multiple global indicators for 131 countries, including:
- **Year:** The year for which the data is recorded(e.g., 2015, 2020, 2024)
- **Country:** The name of the country.
- **GDP_per_capita:** Gross Domestic Product per capita, which is a measure of a country's economic outout per person.
- **Education_Attainment:** The level of education achieved by the population.
- **Life_Expectancy:** The average number of years a person is expected to live.
- **Unemployment_Rate:** The percentage of the labour force that is unemployed.
- **Happiness Score(target):** A metric measuring the self-reported happiness of individuals in a country.

### Data Preprocessing

#### Initial Cleaning Steps(Chat GPT)
- **Country Name Standardisation**: Converted to title case.
- **Education_Attainment**:
  - Missing values filled using **country-wise median**.
  - Remaining nulls filled with **overall median**.

- **Life_Expectancy**:
  - Applied **country-wise linear interpolation**.
  - Remaining missing values filled with **overall mean**.
- Final dataset contains **no missing values**.

- Outputs:
  - `gpt_merged_dataset.csv`

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
![2023 Life Expactancy Missingness](/assets/images/jupyter/2023_life_expactancy_missingness.png)

- **GDP per capita** shows a **strong positive correlation** with **Happiness Score** (linear trend observed).
- **Impact of Life Expectancy Missingness on Happiness Score**
  - Countries **missing Life Expectancy data** in 2023 showed **significantly lower average Happiness Scores** (mean â‰ˆ 5.24) compared to those with available data (mean â‰ˆ 6.66).
  - Countries with available 2023 life expectancy data tend to report higher minimum happiness scores and tighter variance, implying they may be technologically advanced or more transparent.
  - Although the mean happiness score is clearly lower for countries with missing life expectancy data, the imbalance in group size (103 vs 28) suggests caution in interpreting statistical differences.
  - The absence of data in other countries might not directly reflect poor life expectancy, but could stem from limited data infrastructure, delayed reporting cycles, or geopolitical factors.
- Identified a few **outlier countries** with **low GDP per capita but high Happiness Score** â€” flagged for further qualitative analysis.
- Visualised trends using **scatter plots**, **pairplots**, and **correlation heatmaps** for cross-feature relationship assessment.

#### Post Cleaning Steps

- **Lebanon (2023) GDP per capita** manually set to **3350** (source: [TradingEconomics](https://tradingeconomics.com/lebanon/gdp-per-capita-us-dollar-wb-data.html)).
- Applied **country-wise linear interpolation** for:
  - `Education_Attainment`
  - `Life_Expectancy`
- No global imputation needed after interpolation.
- Final dataset contains **no missing values**.
- Outputs:
  - `merged_dataset_v1.1.csv` (manual fix)
  - `merged_interpolated.csv` (interpolated version)

### Modelling
#### ðŸ“Œ Model: RandomForestRegressor
- Trained on cleaned dataset, using features from 2023 for final test.
- Feature Importance: GDP > Life Expectancy > Unemployment > Education

#### Performance Comparison
1. **Model A**: Trained on the dataset with missing values filled with ChatGPT

**Post EDA version:**
![test 2023 interpolation](/assets/images/jupyter/test_2023_interpolation.png)

- **No overfitting observed**: Validation and Test performance are consistent.
- RÂ² ~0.8 indicates **strong predictive power**.

---

### Conclusion & Insights

- The model successfully predicts national happiness based on quantifiable indicators.
- Cleaned data greatly improved predictive performance (compared to RÂ² ~0.6 on unoptimised data).
- Results suggest that **economic strength, education, and health indicators** are key drivers of national happiness.
- However, the model shows a tendency to **underestimate happiness scores for low-GDP countries**, indicating **an over-reliance on GDP-related features**.
- This highlights the need for **further feature engineering** to incorporate non-economic factorsâ€”such as cultural, social, or environmental elementsâ€”especially for economically weaker nations, to better capture the multifaceted nature of happiness.

### Model Misestimation & Root Cause Hypothesis
![Feature Importance](/assets/images/jupyter/Feature_Importance_interpolation.png)
- Preliminary analysis suggested a tendency to underestimate happiness in low-GDP countries.
- However, further validation is required to confirm if **low GDP consistently aligns with low happiness**, or if other socio-political factors are contributing.
- Potential causes of underestimation include:
  - **Feature bias** toward GDP in the training data
  - **Incomplete or imputed data** for low-income nations
  - **Underrepresentation** of low-GDP countries in training samples
  - **Uncaptured factors** like trust, safety, and cultural context

---

### Next Step

- Enhance model robustness by incorporating **non-economic features**, particularly for low-GDP countries (e.g., social trust, freedom, mental well-being).
- Integrate **qualitative or geopolitical indicators** such as governance quality, safety perception, and civil liberties.
- Conduct **targeted feature engineering** to reduce bias toward GDP and better capture drivers of happiness across varying economic contexts.
- Analyse **outlier countries** (high happiness, low GDP) to uncover latent factors through domain research or case studies.
- Apply **clustering and temporal analysis** to identify evolving happiness patterns and region-specific trends over time.
- Evaluate model generalisation using **cross-year validation** to ensure robustness beyond the 2023 dataset.
