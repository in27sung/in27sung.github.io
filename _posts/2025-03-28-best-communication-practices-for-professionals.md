Some of your interactions will be through meetings and one-on-one conversations, and even formal presentations. Each interaction requires an indivisualised approach to ensure that your audience understands what you are trying to communicate. The following seven tips can help guide your communication, no matter what form it taskes or what stage of PACE your project is in:

#### 1. Speak the language of your audience 

Identify the needs of your audience. It's important to know the objectives of the person you are communicating with. Focusing on their needs allows you to gain insight and assess how technical the conversation sould be. Consider the following questions:

- why has this person contacted you?

- what does your stake holder want from this interaction?

- what's important to them, their team, or their organisation?

In your role as a data professional, you will interact with a variety of stakeholders. Determine what they know, and what might go beyound their level of involvement in a project.

- Break down technical concpets into simpler terms.

- Use shorter sentences so main ideas are easier to understand and remember.

- Pay attention to diverse backgrounds and respect the lived experiences of others.

**Pro tip:** Avoid jargon, acronyms, and technical "buzzwords" that could lead to confusion.

#### 2. Invite questions and welcome feedback 

Everyone can use feedback-whether it is positive reinforcement or areas for improvement. When you are focused on the details of a task, It's possible to overlook something. Another person's feedback offers you a great way to gather insights for your personal growth and proffesional excellence. By accepting the challenge that feedback and questions present, you will strengthen your own skills and help the overall project.

- Merge your passion for finding solutions with the goals of the project.

- Continue to strive for greater understanding of the results.

- Elicit feedback and questions to improve communication about your projects.

- Consider opportunities to reflect on your communication skills.

**Pro tip:** Analyse feedback. It is valid? Does the person have a complete understanding of the goals of the project or data analytical process? If not, set up an additional meeting to help clarify.

#### 3. Be the connection to the data 

**You are your teamâ€™s direct connection to the insights your data offers. Your goal is to help other stakeholders understand the process and how it addresses their needs. When everyone understands the process, communication can be highly effective.**

#### 4. Let your visualizations help tell the story 
Visualizations are one of the best ways to communicate ideas, especially when dealing with big data. Visual references help bring to life the details inside your data. Graphs, charts, and infographics can promote general understanding. Later you will explore Tableau, a visualization tool that you can use to create compelling visuals from data.

- Be sure that your visuals tell the story within the data.

- Design visualizations for inclusivity.

- Use labels and text to clarify, not clutter. 

- Use fonts that are easy to read.
