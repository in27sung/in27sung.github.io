This reading provides best practices for successful communication that you can follow in your workplace communication.

#### Understadning why 

Having a clear vision of why you are communicating is first thing you need to consider. Your "why" depends on the context set by the business or organisation you work for as well as the goals orienting the project. When crafting any form of communication, use your why to guide main ideas so that your audience can identify how to act or respond with purpose.

When you prepare to communicate, take a momonet to ouline important goals and expactation you have, like:

- Goals of the project you are communicating about

- What you hope to gain from this communication

- What you're asking your audience to do 

- What you need your audience to understand 

Understanding your why behind your communication will help you organise your throughts and develop clearer, more direct communication.

#### Set the stage 

When you are developing effective communication, you have to consdier more than just the why-you also need to think about *where* the communication is taking place. Setting will have a direct impact on how your message is delivered and how you shape it. As you prepare to communicate, consider the most appropriate way to communicate for the setting you plan to be in.

On the job, it's possible that you will communicate in a variety of settings. What information you share, how you share it, and how you follow up will depend on the context of that communication. For example, you might:

- Ask a coworker for advice about a recent obstacle over lunch

- Send an email updating all the stakeholders about an important project

- Share progress with your team in a weekly meeting

- Present the results of your analysis to a boardroom of executives 

Each of these setting will require you to consider how you're communicating, what each of those audiences need, and what you need from them in return. As you develop your communication skills, don't forget that the setting can be just as important as the actual communiction.
