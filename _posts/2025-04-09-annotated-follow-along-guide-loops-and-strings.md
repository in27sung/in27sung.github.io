## Annotated follow-along guide: Loops and strings

This notebook contains the code used in the instructional videos from [Module 3: Loops and strings](https://www.coursera.org/learn/get-started-with-python/home/module/3).

### Introduction

This follow-along guide is an annotated Jupyter Notebook organized to match the content from each module. It contains the same code shown in the videos for the module. In addition to content that is identical to what is covered in the videos, you’ll find additional information throughout the guide to explain the purpose of each concept covered, why the code is written in a certain way, and tips for running the code.

As you watch each of the following videos, an in-video message will appear to advise you that the video you are viewing contains coding instruction and examples. The in-video message will direct you to the relevant section in the notebook for the specific video you are viewing. Follow along in the notebook as the instructor discusses the code.

To skip directly to the code for a particular video, use the following links:

```python
# Instantiate a counter.
x = 0

# Create a while loop that prints "not there yet," increments x by 1, a 
# and prints x until x reaches 5.
while x < 5:
    print('Not there yet, x=' + str(x))
    x = x + 1
    print('x=' + str(x))
```

    Not there yet, x=0
    x=1
    Not there yet, x=1
    x=2
    Not there yet, x=2
    x=3
    Not there yet, x=3
    x=4
    Not there yet, x=4
    x=5



```python
# Import the random module to be able to create a (pseudo) random number.
import random

number_of_guesses = 0                           # Instantiate guess counter

while number_of_guesses < 5:
    print('Guess a number between 1 and 25: ')  # Tell user to guess number
    guess = input()                             # Produce the user input field
    guess = int(guess)                          # Convert guess to integer

    Correct! You guessed the number in 2 tries!

    The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
    
    
    
    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    
    Simple is better than complex.
    
    Complex is better than complicated.
    
    Flat is better than nested.
    
    Sparse is better than dense.
    
    Readability counts.
    
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    
    Although practicality beats purity.
    
    Errors should never pass silently.
    
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    
    Now is better than never.
    
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
    
    I'm done.
